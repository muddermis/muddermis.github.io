      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 24px;">Track Your Emotional Wellbeing, One Day at a Time</h2>
      <p>Mental health isn't something you think about only during a crisis. Small daily check-ins build a practice of self-awareness that can help you catch shifts in your emotional state early — before they become bigger problems. DailyFeels makes this check-in as frictionless as possible.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">A Daily Emotional Check-In That Takes 2 Seconds</h3>
      <p>Every day, DailyFeels asks one simple question: how do you feel? You respond with one of three buttons — good, okay, or bad. No writing, no scales, no analysis paralysis. It's designed to be so quick that you'll actually do it consistently, which is the whole point.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Why Track Your Mental Health Daily?</h3>
      <ul style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.8; padding-left: 20px;">
        <li>Spot downward trends before they escalate</li>
        <li>Understand how seasons, work, and life events affect your mood</li>
        <li>Have objective data to share with a therapist or doctor</li>
        <li>Celebrate good stretches that you might otherwise overlook</li>
        <li>Build a daily mindfulness habit with almost zero effort</li>
        <li>Track how lifestyle changes impact your emotional state over time</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">See Patterns in Your Mood Over Time</h3>
      <p>DailyFeels shows your mood history as a color-coded calendar — green for good days, yellow for okay days, red for rough days. At a glance, you can see weekly patterns, monthly trends, and yearly overviews. These visual patterns often reveal connections between your mood and external factors that might not be obvious from memory alone.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Completely Private</h3>
      <p>Your mental health data is sensitive, and DailyFeels treats it that way. All data is stored locally on your device and synced only through your personal iCloud. There are no third-party servers, no analytics tracking, and no way for anyone else to access your data. There's no account to create — the app works entirely within Apple's privacy ecosystem.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Export Your Data Anytime</h3>
      <p>If you want to share your mood data with a healthcare provider or move it somewhere else, DailyFeels lets you export your full history at any time. Your data is always yours.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Free on the App Store</h3>
      <p>DailyFeels is free to download and use. All features are available at no cost. An optional one-time purchase removes ads for a completely clean experience — no subscriptions, ever.</p>
      <br>
