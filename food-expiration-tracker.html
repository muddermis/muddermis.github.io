      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 24px;">Reduce Food Waste, Starting With Your Freezer</h2>
      <p>The average household throws away hundreds of dollars worth of frozen food each year — not because it goes bad, but because it gets forgotten. That bag of vegetables pushed to the back, the leftover soup from months ago, the meat you bought on sale. When you can't see it, you can't eat it.</p>
      <br>

      <p>FRZR is a food expiration tracker designed specifically for freezers. It gives you a clear inventory of everything you've frozen so you can use food before it deteriorates, plan meals around what you already have, and stop buying things you don't need.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">How Freezer Tracking Reduces Food Waste</h3>
      <ul style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); line-height: 1.8; padding-left: 20px;">
        <li>See exactly what frozen items you have at a glance</li>
        <li>Know when items were frozen so you can use older food first</li>
        <li>Avoid buying duplicates of items you already have in the freezer</li>
        <li>Plan meals based on your actual frozen food inventory</li>
        <li>Keep your freezer organized so nothing gets buried and forgotten</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Perfect for Every Type of Freezer</h3>
      <p>Whether you have a small top-mounted kitchen freezer, a side-by-side fridge-freezer, a chest freezer in the garage, or a dedicated deep freeze in the basement — FRZR handles them all. Create separate freezers in the app with compartments that match your actual drawer and shelf layout.</p>
      <br>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Household-Friendly Food Tracking</h3>
      <p>FRZR lets you invite family members to shared freezers. Everyone in the household can see what's available, add new items after grocery shopping, and remove items as they get used. No more texting to ask "do we have any chicken in the freezer?"</p>
      <br>

      <h3 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Syncs Across All Your Apple Devices</h3>
      <p>Check your freezer inventory from your phone at the grocery store, update it from your iPad while cooking, or browse it on your Mac while meal planning. FRZR syncs everything through iCloud automatically — no account creation needed.</p>
      <br>
